[1. Session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lpDRE3Fcj0&feature=youtu.be)      
**Summary** 
-  Operating System Provisioning `Bare Metal`, `Cloud Computing`, `Virtualization` and `Docker`
Note: We use docker because it has less provinsion time like `1 sec` to completely install and load the os, while others take `30-60 mins`
-  `systemctl status docker` - docker status, `systemctl start docker` - starts the docker but as soon as the system is restarted it gets stop, `systemctl enable docker` - these help to enable the docker services on even after the system restart, `systemctl stop docker` - stops the docker, `docker info`- To have more information about docker, `docker ps` - gives the os(how many) are running inside the docker, `docker images` - gives the no.of images we have. `docker pull <os-required>:<version>` - downloads the os image from the docker community (which has all the os images at public repository `hub.doc`)
