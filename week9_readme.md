## WEEK 9
### DAY 12 | 3 October | [12. Python 3 API and CGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQh4Qto_V68&feature=youtu.be)

**[Summary](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iiec-rise_iiec-iiecabrrise-iiecabrconnect-activity-6718210808234418176-1QNB/)**
-  For loop can make iterations with in the range (with being mentioning the range)
```python
x = [1,2,3,4,5]
for i in x:
    x = i * i
    print(x)
```
-  In python List comprehension can utilize conditional statements to modify existing list or tuple and can store the modify values another list/tuple which creates statements in one line only and makes more readable and efficient
```python
x = [1,2,3,4,5]
y=[i*i for i in x]
y

# o/p: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```
-  Function is a set of statements executed when the function call until it is not perform any operations.
-  To define the function can use def keyword before the function name
```python
def iiec():
	print("hi")
iiec()
```
-  Parentheses used in the function to call the function to perform the operation in the block of code in function.
