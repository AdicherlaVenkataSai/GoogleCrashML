## WEEK 4
### DAY 6 | 29 August | [6. Python 3 API and CGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXddYlWr6p8&feature=youtu.be)  
**[Summary](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iiec-rise_iiec-iiecabrrise-iiecabrconnect-activity-6705526536956612608-Ne9d)**

-  Integrating html with python and building a interactive web page. (with python as a backend)
- By default type of input box is 'text', can change it to button, radio, checkboxes.
-  `fieldstorage()` is used to get input from client through web url, `fieldstorage()` - get value, `getvalue()` - retrieve the data from the field.
-   All the browsers have HTML interpreter, web servers never runs the code. It sends the code to client browser, browser runs all the html tags & then display it.
-  Tags bold -`<b>`, underline - `<u>`, break - `<br>`, header - `<h>`. 
-  We can use a variable to store the input data & can send it to any server through url using http protocol. Form decides where to take the data `<form action= 'server_url'>`.
-  Radio box acts as a variable, Check box acts as an list. I have explained it clearly [here](https://github.com/AdicherlaVenkataSai/iiec-python/blob/master/week4_readme.md) 

### DAY 7 | 30 August | [7. Python 3 API and CGI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osbBiyxTRHg&feature=youtu.be)  
**[Summary](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iiec-rise_iiec-iiecabrrise-iiecabrconnect-activity-6705891081852084224-xvRi)**
-  About the ARTH and INIT programs.
-  To to interact with OS `CLI`, `GUI`, `WebUI` and `MobileUI`.
-  `curl url` which runs the page and shows the output in the cmd prompt.
-  To see the header of a file we can use `curl -I url`.
-  Redirection - When we search with the link `http://www.gmail.com/` it automatically redirects to actual url `https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/`  which is hidden at the header filed `location: url`.
-  Learn more about the concept of new line - the browser understands that whatever is before the new line is a header and after it is the body.
-  Query string is a part of the url where we can see the value which is assigned to a variable `http://ip/cgi-bin/f.py?x=cal` here `x=cal`.
