## 1. Menu-Driven program (command based)   
Approach | [code](https://github.com/AdicherlaVenkataSai/iiec-python/blob/master/projects/1.%20Menu-Driven(commands%20based)/app.py) | [snaps](https://github.com/AdicherlaVenkataSai/iiec-python/tree/master/projects/1.%20Menu-Driven(commands%20based)/snaps)    

-  First i developed the exit condition for the infinite loop with appropriate messages, in parallel i have taken care of negation cases(not to exit).
-  Then if we entre empty input(no input) then i print a message, either to google it or re-enter the input, this condiition works if well for both the cases like if i enter anything which isn't available i can directly search it else i print a message to have a look at help function, which has the acceptable commands in it.
-  I used clear function in order to avoid the mess and look clean in case of  more commands used.
-  This code clear the bug of no/donot search/launch/start of the commands, but it isn't capable of handling commands like `dont start chrome but start firefox`, am working on it.
