-  When we have the `dataset` we can perfrom `queries(search)`, `data analysis(historical data)` and `data analytics(future data)`.  
-  Dimensions are the way data is stored that is if data which is stored has only one row and one column then it is called `1D` and it has multiple rows and columns then we can categories it as `2D`.
-  On historical data we can perform queries else we can do data analysis. 
-  It is possible to store multi dimensional data structure in list by using list inside list. 
-  Functions are used to perform a particular operation on the data. 
-  Data analysis is a process of examining the data and drawing out the conclusions. 
-  Data analytics is a process of examining the data and drawing out the futuristic conclusions or predictions.
-  Data structure is used to arrange unstructured or tidy data into a structured manner.
